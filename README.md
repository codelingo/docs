CodeLingo Docs

This repo generates a static HTML site from markdown. Docs for the different versions are organised by branch. The master branch is for changes that should apply to all versions. All other branches should keep up-to-date with the master branch. The lex-sdk and bot-sdk branches are merged with the onprem branch at the point of deploying the platform for a client who has those licences.

See here to run the site: http://www.mkdocs.org

Documentation on the individual repositories should be kept in sync with this repo. We should look to automate this in the future.
