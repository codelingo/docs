# Overview

Rules live in codelingo.yaml files in your repository and are used by Actions to automate tasks. You can think of a Rule as an underlying principle guiding a workflow.

In the Golang Rule [sprintf](https://www.codelingo.io/rules/codelingo/go/sprintf) below, the Review Action uses the Rule to make sure `errors.New` is being used correctly and attaches a comment to the line where the `go.call_expr` is found, using the `@review comment` decorator:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: sprintf
    actions:
      codelingo/docs:
        body: Find instances of 'errors.New(fmt.Sprintf(...))'.
      codelingo/review:
        comment: Should replace errors.New(fmt.Sprintf(...)) with errors.Errorf(...).
    query: |
      import codelingo/ast/go
  
      @review comment
      go.call_expr(depth = any)
        go.selector_expr:
          go.ident:
            name == "errors"
          go.ident:
            name == "New"
        go.args:
          go.call_expr:
            go.selector_expr:
              go.ident:
                name == "fmt"
              go.ident:
                name == "Sprintf"
```

Examples of problems that can be solved with Rules & Actions include:

- Project specific practices: scaling the tacit knowledge of senior engineers to the whole team.
- Infrastructure specific guidelines / safeguards: learning from failures.
- Change management: large scale incremental refactoring.
- Packaging the authorâ€™s guidance with a library.
- Anything a static linter expresses, with a fraction of the code.

# Adding Rules

There are four ways to add Rules to your project:

1. The easiest is to use the CodeLingo Dashboard:

Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://www.codelingo.io/dashboard) and, assuming you already have at least one public repository on GitHub, follow the tutorial.

2. The second is to import a bundle of Rules by writing directly to a codelingo.yaml file in one of your repositories:

```yaml
rules:
  - import: codelingo/go
```

In the example above `codelingo` is the Bundle owner and `go` is the Bundle name. More Rule bundles from the CodeLingo community can be found [here](https://www.codelingo.io/rules).

3. The third way is to import individual Rules from a Bundle:

```yaml
rules:
  - import: codelingo/go/goto
  - import: codelingo/go/sprintf
```

4. The final way is to write a new Rule directly in the codelingo.yaml file:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: find-funcs
    actions:
      codelingo/docs:
        title: "Example Rule that finds all func decls"
      codelingo/review:
        comment: "This is a function."

    query:
      import codelingo/ast/go
  
      @review comment
      go.func_decl
```

# Structure of a Rule

A Rule consists of [Metadata](#metadata), [Actions](#actions), and the [Query](#query) itself.

```yaml
# ...
rules:
  - name: # ...
    actions: # ...
    query: # ...
# ...
```

## Metadata

Metadata describes the Rule. It is used for discovery and documentation. The `name` uniquely names the Rule within the Bundle and the other Rules that may be in the same codelingo.yaml, for example:

```yaml
# ...
rules:
  - name: four-or-less
    actions: 
    # ...
    query:
# ...
```

## Actions

Rules on their own do nothing until a Action uses it. The Action section configures the Actions that can use this Rule, for example:

```yaml
# ...
actions:
  codelingo/review:
    comment: "This is a function."
# ...
```

#### Note:

We have deprecated flows in favor of actions. Please modify your codelingo.yaml files accordingly.

## Query

The query is made up of three parts:

- Import statement to include the relevant [Lexicon(s)](CLQL.md#lexicons)
- The statement of CLQL Facts
- Decorators which extract features of interest to Action Functions

For example:

```yaml
# ...
rules:
  - # ...
    query:
      import codelingo/ast/php         # import statement

      @review comment                  # Action Function decorator
      php.stmt_function(depth = any)  # the CLQL fact statement
# ...
```

Here we've imported the PHP Lexicon and are looking for function statements at any depth, which is to say we're looking for functions defined anywhere in the target repository. Once one is found, the Review Action is going to attach it's comment to the file and line number of that function.

Here is a more complex example:

```yaml
# ...
rules:
  - name: debug-prints
    actions: # ...
    query: |
      import codelingo/ast/python36

      @review comment
      python36.expr(depth = any):
        python36.call:
          python36.name:
            id == "print"
# ...
```

This particular Rule looks for debug prints in Python code.

Note: The decorator `@review comment` is what integrates the Rule into the Review Action, detailing where the comment should be made when the pattern matches. Generally speaking, query decorators are metadata on queries that functions use to extract named information from the query result.
<!-- TODO add more decorators example -->

## Action Functions

Actions are made up of a pipeline of serverless functions, called Action Functions.

In the example below, the review function builds a comment from a Rule query which can be used by a Action to comment on a Pull Request made to Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab or the like. It does this by extracting the file name, start line and end line to attach the comment to via the `@review comment` Action Function query decorator. See [Query Decorators as Feature Extractors](#query) for more details.

```yaml
# ...
rules:
  - name: four-or-less
    actions:
      codelingo/review:
        comment: Please write functions that only take a maximum of four arguments.
    query:
      import codelingo/ast/php
      @review comment
      php.stmt_function(depth = any)
# ...
```
