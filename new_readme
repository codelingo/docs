First, [install the CodeLingo GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codelingo). This will enable CodeLingo Flows to be run on your repositories. The Review Action is enabled by default and reviews pull requests to you repos, using Rules stored in your repository inside a codelingo.yaml file. A Rule is made up of a `name`, a `doc` specifiying what the Rule does, `actions` that use this Rule and a `query` used by the Action:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: sprintf-error
    actions:
      codelingo/docs:
        body: Find instances of 'errors.New(fmt.Sprintf(...))'.
      codelingo/review:
        comment: Should replace errors.New(fmt.Sprintf(...)) with errors.Errorf(...).
    query: |
      import codelingo/ast/go
  
      @review.comment
      go.call_expr(depth = any):
        go.selector_expr:
          go.ident:
            name: "errors"
          go.ident:
            name: "New"
        go.args:
          go.call_expr:
            go.selector_expr:
              go.ident:
                name: "fmt"
              go.ident:
                name: "Sprintf"
```

## Rules

Rules live in codelingo.yaml files in your repository and are used by Flows to automate tasks. You can think of a Rule as an underlying principle guiding a workflow.

In the sprintf-error Rule above, the Review Action uses the Rule to make sure `errors.New` is being used correctly and attaches a comment to the line where the `go.call_expr` is found, using the `@review.comment` decorator.

### Adding Rules

There are three ways to add Rules to a codelingo.yaml file:

1. The easist is to import a bundle of Rules:

```yaml
rules:
  - import: codelingo/go
```

In the example above `codelingo` is the bundle owner and `go` is the bundle name. More Rule bundles from the community can be found [here](https://github.com/codelingo/hub/tree/master/rules).https://github.com/codelingo/hub/tree/master/rules

2. The second way is to import individual Rules from a bundle:

```yaml
rules:
  - import: codelingo/go/goto
  - import: codelingo/go/sprintf
```

3. The third way is to write a new Rule directly in the codelingo.yaml file:

```
rules:
  - name: find-funcs
    actions:
      codelingo/docs:
        title: "example Rule that finds all func decls"
      codelingo/review:
        comment: "this is a function"

query:
  import go
  
  @review.comment
  go.func_decl
```

---

Publishing a Rule Bundle

To publish a Rule Bundle, make a pull request to github.com/codelingo/hub and add a folder under:

```
rules/
  <your-codelingo-username>/
    <bundle-name>/
      <rule-name>/
        codelingo.yaml
```

_Find and Share CodeLingo Resources_

The CodeLingo Hub is an Open source collection of CodeLingo Resources.

* Lexicons - Libraries for DSLs, such as a language AST or VCS. Provides facts for queries.
* Rules -  Patterns and anti-patterns in your software stack written in CLQL.
* Flows - pipelines for process augmentation and automation.
* Bots - agents that integrate with your services and data stores.

If you are first getting started with CodeLingo please [check out the getting started guide](https://codelingo.io/docs/getting-started).

To use CodeLingo locally, you will need to install the CLI tool which [can be found here](https://github.com/codelingo/lingo)

For any questions please **[join the conversation in Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/codelingo/shared_invite/enQtMzY4MzA5ODYwOTYzLWVhMjI1ODU1YmM3ODAxYWUxNWU5ZTI0NWI0MGVkMmUwZDZhNWYxNGRiNWY4ZDY0NzRkMjU5YTRiYWY2N2FlMmU)**


## Lexicons
Lexicons provide the DSL for querying against a particular domain, specifically programming languages, version control, runtime, and databases.

Lexicons are imported as part of a CLQL query. Please see the documentation for more information about using Lexicons.

Lexicons are currently available for the follow programming languages:

[Go](lexicons/ast/codelingo/go), [Python](lexicons/ast/codelingo/python), [PHP](lexicons/`ast/codelingo/php), [C++](lexicons/ast/codelingo/c++), [C#](lexicons/ast/codelingo/csharp)

If you are interested in writing your own lexicon, please contact us at hello@codelingo.io

## Rules
Rules are stored patterns and queries that can be applied to your software stack. All Rules are constructed in CLQL and rely on specific lexicons.

Pre-written Rules found in the Hub can be imported within your lingo file as follows: 
```
rules:
  - import codelingo/go/empty-slice
```

All pre-written Rules are available within this repository, and simply be explored through the file structure. For example, [here is a Rule for Go](rules/codelingo/go/goto) that uses of goto

For more information and about writing your own Rules, please [see the documentation](https://codelingo.io/docs/concepts/rules/)

## Flows
Rules are integrated into your workflow through Flows. Flows are automated and semi-automated processes that rely heavily on bots (integrations) to drive your software development lifecycle. They are completely customizable pipelines and can be configured directly in YAML or via the UI.

Currently the default Action is the review Action. Custom Flows are currently in development.
